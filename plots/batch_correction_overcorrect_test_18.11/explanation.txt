corrected folder just has UMAP from scanvi corrected rep, cnvs -> cancer_state_inferred inferred from corrected rep.
uncorrected folder has cancer_state_inferred inferred from raw X and has a UMAP of raw rep and scanvi rep.

All use default params other than mindist = 0.2 (nneighbours 15, euclidean for neighours function)

we can see that the known issue occurs where umap plots that should look the same do not look the same (X_scANVI_corrected UMAP from corrected and uncorrected folder)
prbly some issue with shifting around matrices.

But we can see regardless that the cancer_state_inferred from just X overlaps a lot more with the cancer_state than the CSI from the corrected rep.
This is prbly because the correction skews cancerous vs normal cells (eg it pulls some cells from normal batches to cancer and then the get CSId as "cancerous)

regardless, we cannot really fix this because using x for cnv inferrence is not an option as there are massive batch effects as can be seen in state_of_pipeline_24.10
so the only way to fix it would maybe be to have a reference batch to correct to that has both normal and cancer cells but we do not have this,
so we must live with it.
