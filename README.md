# Bachelor_thesis_pipeline
This repository contains the code I write for my bachelor thesis project involving boolean network inference on scRNAseq data and subsequent attractor analysis

IMPORTANT INFO: Some scripts import functions from other repository native scripts. To make sure this works, run scripts from console in root of repository with "python -m folder.subfolder...script".
