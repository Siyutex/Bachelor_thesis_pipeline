- the cancer and noncancer cells of where not all merged into one by scvi which means it can conserve the differnce 
	- while hopefully correcting batch effects, but that is not evident by the cancer vs noncancer figures

- the batches where quite overlapping before correction, but after correction the are more seperate, this is quite odd
	- it means maybe batch differences where interpreted as biological differences 

- In general, I would say this does not rule out batch correction with scVI /svANVI
	- so I should annote all cells using celltypist
	- then recorrect with scANVI
	- I have 2 advantages now
		- scANVI is better than scVI
		- I can verify if biologically similar cells cluster together after correction, while batches are dispersed throughout one another
		(- before correction, batches should be more isolated, while potentially still having biologicall similar cells cluster close to eachother)
