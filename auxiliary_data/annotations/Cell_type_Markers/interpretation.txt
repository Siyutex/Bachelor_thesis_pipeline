Epithelial cells:
Seem to be lower in cancer than in adjacent tissue (which is NOT normal tissue, it is close to the tumor)
this could be explained by fibrosis in tumor replacing epithelial cells. They are never super high 50+%
which is a bit odd, because Pancreas is mostly Acinar cells which are epithelial. But, those are apparently fragile
(according to ChatGPT, so verify this) and can get destroyed in droplet based scRNAseq methods which would explained
the disturbance. Additionally, the group the OG_PDAC data is from used a 40Âµm cell strainer which may have removed
aggregates of epithelial cells and reduced the fraction that way. Additionally, it was a TME centric study
which makes it more likely that a lot of the preparation parameters where chosen to favor immune cells.
This is also reflected in the high immune cell counts in all OG_PDAC datasets.

Immune cells:
quite high across the board. It is said that PDAC can often be immunosupressive which does not Seem
to be the case here. The CD45 marker does not lie though, if it has CD45 it is an immune cell.

fibroblasts:
see epithelial explanation

endothelial_cells:
probably higher than expected because of vascularization in tumor and adjacent tissue

smooth_muscle_cell / pericytes:
associated with vascularization

other:
dropped to nearly 0 as soon as I set cutoff for other below the mean expression of each marker set
(was at 0, now I set it to -0.2 stdevs from mean)

unsure: quite low across the board at 0.8 * hihgest_marker. Maybe this changes if I cull more agressively, though.
