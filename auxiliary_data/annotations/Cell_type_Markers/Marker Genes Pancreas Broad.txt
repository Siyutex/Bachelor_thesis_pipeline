1. Epithelial (exocrine + endocrine) (general markers first, subset if needed)
	General epithelial: EPCAM, KRT8, KRT18, KRT19 (keratins), CDH1 (E-cadherin)
	Exocrine (acinar + ductal):
		Acinar: PRSS1, PRSS2, CPA1, CPA2, AMY2A/B, CELA3A
		Ductal: CFTR, SOX9, KRT19, MUC1
	Endocrine (islets of Langerhans):
		α-cells: GCG (glucagon)
		β-cells: INS (insulin)
		δ-cells: SST (somatostatin)
		PP cells: PPY (pancreatic polypeptide)
		ε-cells: GHRL (ghrelin)

2. Stromal / mesenchymal
	Fibroblasts / stellate cells: *see beneath for literature concurrent marker panel
	Endothelial (vasculature): PECAM1 (CD31), VWF (von Willebrand factor), CLDN5
	Pericytes / smooth muscle: RGS5, PDGFRB, ACTA2 (also here)

3. Immune
	Pan-immune: PTPRC (CD45) — universal leukocyte marker 
	Subtypes (if you need rough breakdown):
		T cells: CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD8A
		B cells / plasma cells: CD19, CD79A, MS4A1 (CD20), MZB1
		NK: NCAM1 (CD56), NKG7, GNLY
		Macrophages/monocytes: CD14, CD68, LYZ, FCGR3A (CD16)
		Dendritic cells: ITGAX (CD11c), CLEC9A
		Neutrophils: S100A8, S100A9, FCGR3B
		Mast cells: TPSAB1, KIT
