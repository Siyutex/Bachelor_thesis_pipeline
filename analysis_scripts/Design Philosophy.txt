General design: 
	- name all folder with "_" and standard english letters to avoid messed up pathing
	- Relative filepaths
		- use "/" instead of "\" as the latter is an escape character in
	  python
	- use functions
	- explain everything with comments
	- pipeline executor files to run pipeline in modules


Error Handling Philosophy for Thesis & Reusable Code

    ✅ Add minimal, practical error checks (e.g., missing files, wrong paths)

    ✅ Provide clear, readable error messages for common user mistakes

    ✅ Prioritize code I can reliably re-run months later without debugging (this is why comments and error handling are important)

    ✅ Keep GitHub repos clean and understandable to show competence, but avoid over-engineering
