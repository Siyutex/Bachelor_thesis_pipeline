GRN_edge_inference:
  - weird edges like MMP9 -> PENK are captured: use bootstrapping (may need to use cluster for this)
  - we always keep top 5 edges per node atm, but some might have more than 5 relevant ones, others 
    less (maybe introduce a cutoff in importance for top n selection)
  - might need to use pseudotime based inference to get good edges
GRN_rule_inference:
  - possible issues at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree (eg overfitting bsc lacks pruning)
  - if 1 or 0 overweighs for the state of a gene in a dataset (or subset of 1 pseudotime epoch) then gini impurity and entropy 
    will not be good predictors for splits (gini worse than entropy). BUT, since I only work
    on HVGs, it would be reasonable to assume that the class (1 or 0) distribution is somewhat
    even in target (really in all) genes. 
Batch_correction:
  - might be a bit too aggressive so normal cell get too close to cancer (maybe also an issue with reference batch only having either normal or cancer cells)
      (not that bad though, so go back to this if published; also quite hard to fix without reference batch that has c and nc)
Pseudotime: 
  - smallest mean cnv might not be the best proxy for a "normal" cell as the root cell
