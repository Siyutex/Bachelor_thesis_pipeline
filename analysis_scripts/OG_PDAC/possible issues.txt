GRN_edge_inference:
  + weird edges like MMP9 -> PENK are captured: try bootstrapping with ~50% of cells and  
    only keep edges occuring often
  - we always keep top 5 edges per node atm, but some might have more than 5 relevant ones, others 
    less (maybe introduce a cutoff in importance for top n selection)
  - maybe also use random forest classifier in combination with grnboost2 (check what it does under
    the hood) to make edge selection more robust
GRN_rule_inference:
  - possible issues at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree (eg overfitting bsc lacks pruning)
  - if 1 or 0 overweighs for the state of a gene in a dataset (or subset of 1 pseudotime epoch) then gini impurity and entropy 
    will not be good predictors for splits (gini worse than entropy). BUT, since I only work
    on HVGs, it would be reasonable to assume that the class (1 or 0) distribution is somewhat
    even in target (really in all) genes.
